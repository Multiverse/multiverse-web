This page is for the new MV5 version.

## Prerequisites
There are a few things to verify before installing [Multiverse-SignPortals](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-signportals).
* When running other Multiverse modules (such as SignPortals, ensure it's the same version as [Multiverse-Core](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-core). For example, if Multiverse-SignPortals is 4.0.0, Multiverse-Core should be 4.0.0.
* You must have [Multiverse-Core](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-core) before having Multiverse-SignPortals.

## Step 1
Grab the jar.
Download the Multiverse-SignPortals JAR from the [release site](http://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-signportals/files/) or grab a dev build from [the Multiverse 2 Jenkins](http://ci.onarandombox.com/job/Multiverse-SignPortals/)

There is NO Zip package available. Multiverse-Core (and MV Plugins) will create default configs for you __on the first run__.

__*Optional:__ Install the  [Multiverse-NetherPortals](http://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-netherportals/files/) plugin!

Place it in your plugins folder like so:
