Sign Style SignPortals can go to ANY [Multiverse destination](/core/reference/destinations).

## Step 1
Give yourself `multiverse.signportal.create`

## Step 2
Place A sign. Type text in the same format as this (make sure [mv] is on the second line of the sign and world is on the third):

## Step 3
If your `[mv]` turns green, your SignPortal is ready to use. If it [turns red](#wiki-red), re-read step 1 and do that.

**Did your SignPortal turn RED?**

## I was creating a new SignPortal and it turned red
Make sure you have `multiverse.signportal.create`

## I was trying to validate a Legacy SignPortal and it turned red
Make sure you have `multiverse.signportal.validate`
