## Step 3b
If your `[mv]` turns green, continue to step 4. If it [[turns red|invalid-signportal]], re-read step 1 and do that.

## Step 4
You have a green SignPortal now. If you right click it, it will act just like the [[Sign only version|Sign-style-(SignPortals)]]. In order to "validate" it, you must use the portal once yourself. Step into the portal. It should take you to the destination. Once you get back to the portal The `[mv]` should be blue. This means the Portal Style SignPortal is functioning properly.
