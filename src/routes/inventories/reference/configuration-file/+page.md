Here is the default config that ships with MV-Inventories for your reference. All the information on what each config values does is already detailed in the comments within the config file, so please read them.

Note the version number at the bottom. We will (try to) update this page with newer configs when they ship. This is the current version of your config. If it does not **match the version in the example below**, please [grab an updated version of Multiverse-Inventories](https://modrinth.com/plugin/multiverse-inventories#download) and [all of the Multiverse Plugins you use](/download).

Multiverse will **always** migrate your configs for you if we change the format (like when we did `2.7`->`2.8`). With that said, it never hurts to keep backups in case of server failure or a ferret munching a few bytes off the end of a file.
