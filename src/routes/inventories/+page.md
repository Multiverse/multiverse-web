## Prerequisites
There are a few things to verify before installing [Multiverse-Inventories](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-inventories).
* When running other Multiverse modules (such as Inventories), get the latest version of all modules - the slight difference in version number does not matter as long as its all v5.
* You must have [Multiverse-Core](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-core) before having Multiverse-Inventories.

## Step 1
Grab the jar.
Download the Multiverse-Inventories JAR from the [release site](http://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-inventories/files/).

There is NO Zip package available. Multiverse-Core (and MV Plugins) will create default configs for you __on the first run__.


Place it in your plugins folder.

## Step 2
Start your server and enjoy your seperated (and shared) inventories per world! Learn how to setup groups and shares [here](/inventories/fundamentals/basic-usage)!
