## Prerequisites
There are a few things to verify before installing [Multiverse-Inventories](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-inventories).
* When running other Multiverse modules (such as Inventories, ensure it's the same version as [Multiverse-Core](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-core). For example, if Multiverse-Inventories is 4.0.0, Multiverse-Core should be 4.0.0.
* You must have [Multiverse-Core](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-core) before having Multiverse-Inventories.

## Step 1
Grab the jar.
Download the Multiverse-Inventories JAR from the [release site](http://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-inventories/files/) or grab a dev build from [the Multiverse 2 Jenkins](http://ci.onarandombox.com/job/Multiverse-Inventories/)

There is NO Zip package available. Multiverse-Core (and MV Plugins) will create default configs for you __on the first run__.


Place it in your plugins folder like so:

## Step 2
Start your server and enjoy your seperated (and shared) inventories per world!
