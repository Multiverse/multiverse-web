## Prerequisites
There are a few things to verify before installing [Multiverse-NetherPortals](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-netherportals).
* When running other Multiverse modules (such as Portals), get the latest version of all modules - the slight difference in version number does not matter as long as its all v5.

* You must have [Multiverse-Core](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-core) before having Multiverse-NetherPortals.

## Step 1: Ensure you're using the same version as [Multiverse-Core](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-core/files/).
Multiverse-Core is **required** for Multiverse-NetherPortals. If you're using an outdated server and you need Multiverse-Core 2.5, you will need Multiverse-NetherPortals 2.5, If you're using the most updated Minecraft version, get the latest versions of [Multiverse-Core](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-core/files/) and [Multiverse-NetherPortals](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-netherportals/files/).

## Step 2: Download [Multiverse-NetherPortals](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-netherportals/files/)
Grab the version you need (again, if you're using the latest MC version, get the latest Multiverse version) from [here](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-netherportals/files/). Put it in your plugins folder.

## Step 3: Start your server.
Go.
