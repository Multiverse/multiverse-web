title: "Installation"
---

Welcome. We're glad you're here at our humble little wiki. This is a _very_ brief installation guide as there isn't much to do!

## Prerequisites

- Ensure that all of the sub-modules are of the same major version.
- Make sure that you have `multiverse-core` if you are using any sub-modules, it is a dependancy.

## Optional Prerequisites

We highly recommend a permissions plugin. You can use any plugin that implements the SuperPerms API. Here are some known working permission plugins (as of 2025):

- [LuckPerms](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/luckperms-an-advanced-permissions-plugin.28140/) (recommended)

This guide (on the right) will take you through setting up permissions, but if you want to go there now, [click here](/core/reference/permissions-list).

## Download links

## Step 1

Grab the jar.
Download the Multiverse-Core JAR from the [release site](https://modrinth.com/plugin/multiverse-core#download).

There is NO Zip package available. Multiverse-Core (and MV Plugins) will create default configs for you **on the first run**.

**\*Optional:** Install the [Multiverse-Portals](/portals/fundamentals/installation) or [Multiverse-NetherPortals](/netherportals/fundamentals/installation) plugins!

Place it in your plugins folder like so:

## Step 2

Start your server. That's it. Seriously.
