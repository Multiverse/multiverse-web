# Installation

Welcome. We're glad you're here at our humble little wiki. This is a _very_ brief installation guide as there isn't much to do!

## Prerequisites
<!--There are a few things to verify before installing Multiverse.-->
* When running other Multiverse modules (such as Portals, SignPortals, Inventories), ensure they're all on the same version. For example, Multiverse-Portals 4.0.0 should be run with Multiverse-Core.

## Optional Prerequisites
We highly recommend a permissions plugin. You can use any plugin that implements the SuperPerms API. Here are some known working permission plugins (as of 6/16/2019):

 - [LuckPerms](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/luckperms-an-advanced-permissions-plugin.28140/) (recommended)

This guide (on the right) will take you through setting up permissions, but if you want to go there now, [click here](permissions).
## Step 1
Grab the jar.
Download the Multiverse-Core JAR from the [release site](http://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-core/files/) or grab a dev build from [the Multiverse 2 Jenkins](http://ci.onarandombox.com/job/Multiverse-Core/)

There is NO Zip package available. Multiverse-Core (and MV Plugins) will create default configs for you __on the first run__.

__*Optional:__ Install the [Multiverse-Portals](https://github.com/Multiverse/Multiverse-Core/wiki/Install-(Portals)) or [Multiverse-NetherPortals](https://github.com/Multiverse/Multiverse-Core/wiki/Install-(NetherPortals)) plugins!

Place it in your plugins folder like so:

## Step 2
Start your server. That's it. Seriously.
