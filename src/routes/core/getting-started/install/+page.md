Welcome. We're glad you're here at our humble little wiki. This is a _very_ brief installation guide as there isn't much to do!

## Prerequisites
- Ensure that all of the sub-modules are of the same major version.
- Make sure that you have `multiverse-core` if you are using any sub-modules, it is a dependancy.

## Optional Prerequisites
We highly recommend a permissions plugin. You can use any plugin that implements the SuperPerms API. Here are some known working permission plugins (as of 2025):

 - [LuckPerms](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/luckperms-an-advanced-permissions-plugin.28140/) (recommended)

This guide (on the right) will take you through setting up permissions, but if you want to go there now, [click here](permissions).
## Step 1
Grab the jar.
Download the Multiverse-Core JAR from the [release site](http://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-core/files/) or grab a dev build from [the Multiverse 2 Jenkins](http://ci.onarandombox.com/job/Multiverse-Core/)

There is NO Zip package available. Multiverse-Core (and MV Plugins) will create default configs for you __on the first run__.

__*Optional:__ Install the [Multiverse-Portals](https://github.com/Multiverse/Multiverse-Core/wiki/Install-(Portals)) or [Multiverse-NetherPortals](https://github.com/Multiverse/Multiverse-Core/wiki/Install-(NetherPortals)) plugins!

Place it in your plugins folder like so:

## Step 2
Start your server. That's it. Seriously.
