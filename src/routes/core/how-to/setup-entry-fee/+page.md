As with anything currency related, Multiverse uses [Vault](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/vault) and hence it is a dependency to use this feature

## Setting the Price to Enter a world

To set the price to enter a world, simply go to that world and type `/mv modify [world] set price X` where x is the amount to enter.

## Want to use items?

Uhhh, this seems outdated
:::
Simply type: `/mv modify [world] set currency <item>` where <item> is a Minecraft item name or id. You can find a list of them [here](https://minecraftitemids.com).

Don't forget to set the price!

## Example

Let's set the entry to a world named FernWorld to 5 dirt

- `/mv modify FernWorld set price 5`
- `/mv modify FernWorld set currency 3`  
  It's really that easy.
