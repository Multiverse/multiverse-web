As with anything currency related, Multiverse uses [Vault](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/vault) and hence it is a dependency to use this feature

## Setting the Price to Enter a world

To set the price to enter a world, simply go to that world and type `/mvm set price X` where x is the amount to enter.

## Want to use items?

:::caution[unfinished]
Uhhh, this seems outdated
:::
Simply type: `/mvm set currency ITEMID` where ITEMID is a Minecraft item ID. You can find a list of them [here](https://www.minecraftinfo.com/idlist.htm).

Don't forget to set the price!

## Example

Let's set the entry to a world named FernWorld to 5 dirt

- `/mvm set price 5 FernWorld`
- `/mvm set currency 3 FernWorld`  
  It's really that easy.
