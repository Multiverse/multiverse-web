title: "Anchors"
---

## Introduction

In Multiverse you can create anchors that can be used with `/mvtp` (Or anything else that takes a [destination](/core/reference/destinations/)) to create warps.

## Creating Anchors

Anchors can be created using `/mv anchor set <name>`. For example, `/mv anchor set info`.

## Teleporting To Anchors

Anchors can be teleported to using `/mvtp a:<Anchor Name>`. For example: `/mvtp a:info` for the one we just made.

## Removing Anchors

Anchors can be removed in a similar way to how they where created using `/mv anchor delete <name>` for example `/mv anchor delete info`
