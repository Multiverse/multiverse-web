Multiverse 5 has been years in the making, and we are excited to release it to the public! 

Since 2021, we have been working tirelessly to make this the best version of Multiverse ever. At the start of 2025, we released alpha builds of Multiverse version 5 on discord. The feedback we received are very constructive and positive, and have been hard at work improving each alpha build based on the feedbacks. As we officially release the first stable version of Multiverse 5, we will continue to improve it and add more features!

## Call for help with MV5 wiki

The MV5 updates are great, but we need to inform people on how to use them! However writing documentation is a long and laborious process which will take away more dev time. Thus, we are looking for volunteers to help in writing usage guides. 

Our wiki is now hosted on a web page, and the source code is here: https://github.com/Multiverse/multiverse-web

The wiki itself is using markdown formatting. If you are not sure on how to use GitHub, you can send your work via discord too!
