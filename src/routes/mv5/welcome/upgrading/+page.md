## Will I lose my data?

Nope! All configurations should automatically migrate to new format and all your existing worlds, portals, inventory data will still work. There is NO NEED to delete any config.yml, reimport worlds, or relink any portals. If you face any issues, please contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/NZtfKky).
