## Prerequisites
There are a few things to verify before installing [Multiverse-Portals](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-portals).
* When running other Multiverse modules (such as Portals), get the latest version of all modules - the slight difference in version number does not matter as long as its all v5.

* You must have [Multiverse-Core](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-core) before having Multiverse-Portals.

## Step 1
Grab the jar.
Download the Multiverse-Portals JAR from the [release site](http://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-portals/files/).

There is NO Zip package available. Multiverse-Core (and MV Plugins) will create default configs for you __on the first run__.

__*Optional:__ Install the  [Multiverse-NetherPortals](http://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-netherportals/files/) plugin!

## Step 2
Start your server and make some portals!
