  # If the list is empty, all materials are allowed.
  frame-materials: []
  
  # If enabled, nether/end fills will be cleared when the portal is removed.

portal-usage:
  # If enabled, players will not be able to teleport to mvportals they do not have access to.

  # If enabled, when a mvportal with nether fill that is unusable, either due to invalid destination or lack of permissions,
  # will fallback and behave as a normal nether portal teleporting between the nether world.

  # If enabled, the nether blobbing animation will be played before the player is teleported.
  # Note: This does not work if the player is in creative mode due to server software limitations.

  # If enabled, mvportals will teleport all vehicles along with its passengers when the vehicle enters the portal.
  # Vehicles are usually boats and minecarts.
  # (NOTE: please turn off the server before changing this config option)
  teleport-vehicles: false
  
  # If enabled, all living entities can use the portal if property `teleport-non-players` is true.

  # (NOTE: please turn off the server before changing this config option)
  teleport-entities: false
  
  # If enabled, player movement will be tracked to determine if the player/entity has entered a portal.
  # Disabling this will cause mvportals without nether or end fill to not work.
  # Only disable this if all your portals have nether or end fill and want to slight enhance performance.
  # (NOTE: please turn off the server before changing this config option)
  use-on-move: true
  
  
# This just signifies the version number so we can see what version of config you have.
