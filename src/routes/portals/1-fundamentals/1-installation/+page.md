## Prerequisites
There are a few things to verify before installing [Multiverse-Portals](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-portals).
* When running other Multiverse modules (such as Portals, ensure it's the same version as [Multiverse-Core](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-core). For example, if Multiverse-Portals is 4.0.0, Multiverse-Core should be 4.0.0.
* You must have [Multiverse-Core](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-core) before having Multiverse-Portals.

## Step 1
Grab the jar.
Download the Multiverse-Portals JAR from the [release site](http://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-portals/files/) or grab a dev build from [the Multiverse 2 Jenkins](http://ci.onarandombox.com/job/Multiverse-Portals/)

There is NO Zip package available. Multiverse-Core (and MV Plugins) will create default configs for you __on the first run__.

__*Optional:__ Install the  [Multiverse-NetherPortals](http://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-netherportals/files/) plugin!

Place it in your plugins folder like so:
